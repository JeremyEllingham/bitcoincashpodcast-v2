# FAQs

import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";

Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin Cash is an immensely deep topic. However, like anything, there are some questions which almost everyone wonders about at one time or another. This is a collection of answers that are short enough to digest quickly, but long enough to encapsulate a complete idea.

## Pre-FAQ Fundamentals

The FAQs stand alone, however foundational knowledge & background is highly recommended from at least one of:

- [The BCH Podcast Start Guide](/start) or [Episode 85 of the Podcast](/episodes/welcome)
- The book [Hijacking Bitcoin](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin) by Roger Ver with Steve Patterson
- Youtube documentary ["Who Killed Bitcoin?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzIW52Rgc) 

Any reader arriving with a lot of pre-existing knowledge about BTC should be extra self-aware they were likely influenced by [extensive propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc) & so much of this material will be unintuitive, confronting or challenging at first.

Every Bitcoiner should also read the [original Bitcoin whitepaper](/bitcoin.pdf) by Satoshi Nakamoto. Although there are some technical elements, the core principles and motivations of the project are understandable by anyone. Thorough reading of the whitepaper also contains a lot of answers and clues to deeper parts of the Bitcoin system.

## SmartBCH (sBCH)

:::danger

SmartBCH assets are currently under seizure by an insolvent CoinFlex. This is a complicated situation, detailed breakdown can be found in [Episode 52](/episodes/52) and [Episode 53](/episodes/53). Recent updates on [Episode 60](/episodes/60).

It is critically important to research SmartBCH and understand the risks thoroughly before using it in any capacity at this time. Further updates will of course appear on the podcast where notable change has happened, but The Bitcoin Cash Podcast suggests avoiding SmartBCH entirely at this time.
