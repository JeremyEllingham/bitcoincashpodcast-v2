# Code

Bitcoin Cash is a [social movement](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/how-will-BCH-onboard-the-entire-world), but it's also a technical project. The code that runs Bitcoin Cash nodes and miners is all open source, as are many BCH wallets and community tools, which means the full program is available for free for anyone to review, download, copy or submit updates.

Because the code is available to everyone, it is:

- Freely available
- Auditable for security issues
- Open to innovation by anyone, either as a submitted update or by starting a spin-off and making modifications

## This Website

For the same reasons, the entire source code for this website is available to the entire world. Anyone can submit an update, or create their own copy and modify it as they please.

Contributions (pull requests and suggestions) are always welcome from the community!

## For EVM Developers

Welcome! Note that BCH is a UTXO chain and quite different to what you may be used to. This has a bit of a learning curve, however, it comes with a lot of advantages:
