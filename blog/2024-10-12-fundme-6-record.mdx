The Bitcoin Cash Podcast recently completed its 6th round of funding, having switched from Flipstarter as with previous campaigns to the new easier-to-use & exciting [FundMe.cash](https://fundme.cash) tech (thanks Sayoshi Nakamario!).

The Bitcoin Cash Podcast was very fortunate to recently complete a 35 BCH FundMe campaign. Budget was increased in BCH terms (and only very slightly in fiat terms), but the final 5.5 BCH was provided by the Podcast itself to reflect the inability to deliver on the BCH Argentina deliverable (due to circumstances beyond the immediate control of The Podcast).

For more about BCH Fundraising, check out the [FAQ article](/faqs/Tech/what-is-flipstarter).

In the spirit of accountability and transparency, a record of the FundMe campaign is preserved here - for later reference of donators and to demonstrate credibility of & delivery by The Bitcoin Cash Podcast. The original hosted FundMe url (https://fundme.cash/campaign/7) may eventually go stale.
